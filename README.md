## 🚀 Project Idea

**SecurePay Guard** is a web-based dashboard that leverages AI to detect and flag suspicious transaction patterns for retailers in real time, alerting store managers and payment processors to potential fraud—before it impacts business.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Fraud Detection:**  
  Instantly analyzes every new transaction using AI-driven heuristics and rules to identify fraud risks.

- **Dynamic Dashboard:**  
  Beautiful, responsive dashboard built with React, providing at-a-glance statistics and live updates.

- **Fraud Alerts:**  
  Visually highlights flagged transactions, showing trust scores, risk levels, and the specific reasons for suspicion.

- **Transaction Explorer:**  
  Search, filter, and inspect transactions by risk, merchant, amount, time, and more.

- **Simulated Transactions:**  
  Uses AI-driven mock data to demo realistic fraud patterns, including velocity, anomalous device fingerprints, card testing, and more.

- **Secure Authentication:**  
  Login system for store managers and security analysts, ensuring sensitive data is protected.

- **Customizable Risk Rules:**  
  Easily adjust fraud detection thresholds and rules for different business needs.

---

## 🖥️ Main Pages & Navigation

- **Login Page:**  
  Secure entry for authorized users.

- **Dashboard (Overview):**  
  Visual summary of key stats—fraud rate, average trust score, top fraud reasons, and more.

- **Transactions Page:**  
  Table view of all recent transactions with filters for status (approved, flagged, etc.).

- **Real-Time Monitor:**  
  Live feed of transactions as they happen, highlighting and explaining fraud in real time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Python/Flask (or Node.js/Express for demo)  
- **Fraud Engine:** Custom AI heuristics (TypeScript/JS), pluggable with ML models  
- **APIs & Datasets:** Supports integration with public transaction datasets & payment APIs  
- **State Management:** React Context/Redux  
- **Demo Data:** Mock generator simulating real retail transaction flows

## 🤖 How Fraud Detection Works

The AI-driven fraud detection engine evaluates each transaction for:

- **High Amounts:** Unusually large purchase attempts
- **High Velocity:** Many transactions in a short span
- **Unusual Hours:** Activity during suspicious times (e.g., 2–5 AM)
- **Risky Locations:** Purchases from flagged or foreign regions
- **Card Testing Patterns:** Small, repeated amounts matching known testing behaviors
- **Device Anomalies:** Suspicious device fingerprints
- **Proxy/VPN Use:** Transactions from known proxies or private IPs

Each rule increases a transaction’s risk score. If the score exceeds a threshold, the transaction is flagged as suspicious or fraudulent, with clear reasons shown to the user.

---

## 🚦 Example: Real-Time Monitoring

- Transactions stream into the dashboard every few seconds.
- Each is scored for risk, with live visual feedback (green = safe, red = fraud).
- Managers see why a transaction was flagged (e.g., “High velocity,” “Card testing pattern”).

---

## 💡 Unique Aspects

- **Fully Interactive UI:** Live monitoring and drill-downs on any transaction.
- **Explainable AI:** Not just a “black box”—shows exactly *why* a transaction was flagged.
- **Easy Extensibility:** Add new rules or plug in real ML models as needed.
- **No Real Data Required:** Works out-of-the-box with high-fidelity simulated data for demos or hackathons.
